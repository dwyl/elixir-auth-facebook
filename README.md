_Easily_ add `Facebook` login to your `Elixir` / `Phoenix` apps
with step-by-step **_detailed_ documentation**.

## Why?

Facebook authentication is used **_everywhere_**!
Tens of millions of people use it every day.
Facebook Login can be used to authenticate people without planning to access their data.

We wanted to create a reusable `Elixir` package
with beginner-friendly instructions and readable code.

## What?

A simple and easy-to-use `Elixir` package that gives you
**Facebook `OAuth` Authentication** for your **web app**
in a few steps with minimal API.

‚ùóÔ∏è If you target Android or IOS, use the SDK.

> If you're new to `Elixir`,
> please see: [dwyl/**learn-elixir**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-hapi)

## How?

These instructions will guide you through setup in 5 simple steps.
By the end, you will have **login with `Facebook`** in your **Web** App.

> **Note**: if you get stuck,
> please let us know by opening an issue!

## Step 1: Create a Facebook app üÜï

You need to have a Facebook developer account.
It is free. You just use your Facebook account.
You will create an app and get the **credentials** in minutes.

### Step 1.1 Create or use a developer account from your personal Facebook account

Go to <https://developers.facebook.com/apps/>

...after logging in to your Facebook account, you can 'Register Now' for a developer account.

### Step 1.2 Create an App

- select the app type: **"consumer"**
- provide basic info, such as:

  - app name (can be changed)
  - contact name

![type](priv/type.png)

### Step 1.3 Your credentials

Once you are done, you arrive at the Dasboard.
Select **settings**, then **basic**.

![dashboard](priv/dashboard.png)

You will find your **credentials** there.
Copy the App ID and the App Secret into your `.env` file.

```env
# .env
export FACEBOOK_APP_ID=xxxxx
export FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=xxxx
```

### Step 1.4 Specify the base redirect URI

Lastly, you need to set the callback **base URL**.
Your app won't work if a wrong or incomplete base URL is set.

- At the bottom of the form, click on **+ Add platform**

![add platform](priv/add_platform.png)

- click on **Web** in the "Select Platform" modal

![select platform](priv/platform.png)

- a new input will appear: fill the **Site URL** with:
  <http://localhost:4000>

![base url](priv/website.png)

**Note**: this is the base redirect URI, so it has to be an _absolute_ URI, not only the domain. Make sure you include the `http://` prefix.

## Step 2: use the `ElixirAuthFacebook` module

You want to display a **login** link on one of your pages.

### Create a `state` token

You need to generate an "anti-CSRF" protection token.

Type `mix gen.secret 32` in your terminal to generate one.
Append it to the `FACEBOOK_STATE` key in your `.env` file.
Finally run `source .env`.

```env
# .env
export FACEBOOK_APP_ID=1234...
export FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=A1B2C3...
export FACEBOOK_STATE= <--- this new token
```

### Add a login link in your template ‚ú®

Suppose you have a template "page/index.html" rendered by the controller "PageController".

Add the Facebook Login link to the template:

```html.heex
# /lib/app_web/templates/page/index.html.heex

<a class="your-classes" href={@oauth_facebook_url}>
  <img
    src="https://scontent-cdt1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/294967112_614766366879300_4791806768823542705_n.png?_nc_cat=105&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=8sb1L4zz4BUAX_EvUKb&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-cdt1-1.xx&amp;oh=00_AT9npEF786Ao623QdsCGbrNq9s4R9v1xzFeX5GkOkAbT6g&amp;oe=6354DA64"
  />
</a>
```

### Modify the template controller

The `href` value is `@oauth_facebook_url`.
This is an "assign", a key/value map passed to the `conn` struct.
It is set by using the module `ElixirAuthFacebook`.

In the controller that renders the template above, add the code below:

```elixir
# lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex

defmodule AppWeb.PageController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  def index(conn, _p) do
    oauth_facebook_url =
      ElixirAuthFacebook.generate_oauth_ur(conn)

    render(
      conn,
      "index.html",
      oauth_facebook_url: oauth_facebook_url
    )
  end
end
```

### Create the `/auth/facebook/callback` endpoint üìç

Once the user has filled out the dialogue form, he will be redirected to your app.

Add this line to set the redirection in the router.

```elixir
#AppWeb.Router

scope "/", AppWeb do
  pipe_through :browser
  get "/auth/facebook/callback",
    FacebookAuthController, :login
end
```

### Create a `FacebookAuthController`

Last step! We finally need a controller to respond to the endpoint:

```elixir
# lib/app_web/controllers/facebook_auth_controller.ex

defmodule AppWeb.FacebookAuthController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  def login(conn, params) do

    {:ok, profile} =
      ElixirAuthFacebook.handle_callback(
        conn, params
      )

  #[... process the profile for the next render..]
  end
end
```

Done! :rocket:

Facebook will send the user's credentials to the endpoint you created, and the controller/callback will receive them in the `params`.
We use again the `ElixirAuthFacebook` module to handle these "params" and deliver the user's identity.

It eventually sends back the object below which identifies the user :eyes:

```elixir
%{
  access_token: "EAAFNaUA6VI8BAPkCCVV6q0U0tf7...",
  email: "xxxxx",
  fb_id: "10223726006128074",
  name: "Harry Potter",
  picture: %{
    "data" => %{
      "height" => 50,
      "is_silhouette" => false,
      "url" => "xxxxx",
      "width" => 50
    }
  }
}
```

A long-term "access_token" is delivered.
The app can interact with the Facebook ecosystem on behalf of the user with this token. These tokens should be saved in the database and appended to a session. If you intend to do so, have a look at the data deletion policy at the end.

> If you simply need to authenticate a user, this token is useless and everything is fine.

### A note on SSL certificate :lock:

**TL;DR**: if you use this module, you don't need a reverse proxy in DEV mode.

:exclamation: if the user denies the login in this mode, then the app stops since it wants to reach an HTTPS endpoint. This is the only limitation.

#### How-to HTTPS :fearful: locally?

It's a piece of cake with **[Caddyserver](https://caddyserver.com/docs/)**. It supports automatic HTTPS by provisioning and renewing certificates through [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

Install it in minutes, create a file named `CaddyFile` at the root, paste the code below in it, and type `caddy run` in a different terminal. That's it :tada:

```
localhost:443 {
	handle {
		reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4000
	}
}
```

A reverse proxy can enable the HTTPS protocol with an SSL certificate authority.
It is a piece of software between the internet and your app that intercepts the traffic and forwards it back to the app.
Once it is running, your app can be reached at <https://localhost>.
Of course, your app is still running as normal behind, on <http://localhost:4000>. The port differentiates these modes.

### SDK :thought_balloon: ?

The [Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/quickstart) is the alternative _authentication from the browser_.
You **need** to reverse proxy your app (_and also enable the JSSDK in Facebook's app settings_). With Caddyserver, this is made easy for your dev mode.

The SDK usage is demonstrated in the companion repo: **<TODO: elixir_auth_facebook_demo>**.

This solution is preferable when running a free app as you consume less server CPU.

### Notes üìù

All the flow to build the Login flow can be found here:
<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/advanced/manual-flow>

### Meta

#### Privacy Concerns? üîê

No cookie is set. It just provides user authentication.

You have the tokens to do more,‚ùóÔ∏è but need an [opinion(?) on Meta](https://archive.ph/epKXZ).
Use this package as a last resort if you have no other option!

#### Data deletion?

If you want to use the package to access Metas' ecosystem, then you need to provide [a data deletion option](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/overview)

‚ùóÔ∏è To be compliant with GDPR guidelines, you must provide the following:

- A way in your app for users to request their data be deleted
- A contact email address that people can use to reach you to request their data be deleted
- An implementation of the data deletion callback
